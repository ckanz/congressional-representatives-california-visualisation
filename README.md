# congressional-representatives-california-visualisation

This purpose of this project is to create a web application to monitor the behaviour of Californian Members of Congress using the [ProPublica Congress API](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/).

Documentation of the concept phase can be found in the `concept` folder.

The Frontend project itself is located in the `src` folder.

Remaining issues are among others:

* fixing zoom & drag
* fixing the layout (only works for desktop and not that well for different screens)
* breaking down `app.js` file.
* document functions
* add legend and instructions how to interpret the chart to the page
* format statements container
* write tests
* etc
